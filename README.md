This is interesting..... 

Hi. I'm Michael. I'm a software and hardware engineer for industrial automation control systems, hold a PE, and have been doing that work long enough to be competetnt in that arena. I specialize in Rockwell Software more than anything else, but am getting into ML and Python/Anaconda with Tensorflow. And as of this moment in time, I know less than nothing about it. At best I know that I have no idea what the acronyms mean.

So, that means I'll ask stupid questions and not understand the obviously simple, straighforward answer I've been given to the aforementioned stupid question.

Thank you for tolerating yet another nuub deciding to jump in the ML pool.

Mike
